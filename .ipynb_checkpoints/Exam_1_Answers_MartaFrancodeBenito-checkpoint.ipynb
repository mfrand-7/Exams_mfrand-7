Up to 30% of the seeds are aborted, dark and shrunken, and do not germinate. Most of these aborted seeds contain embryos arrested at the globular stage as well as ball/oblong-shaped embryos (ca. 75%). The morphogenesis of these embryos was blocked before initiation of cotyledon growth and establishment of bilateral symmetry. The other aborted seeds contain embryos arrested at the torpedo or bent cotyledon stage with abnormal- shaped, thickened hypocotyls and underdeveloped cotyledons (ca. 25%).

The level of methylglyoxal (MG) is doubled in mutant seedlings. Total lipid content is slightly reduced, but there are notable differences between various lipid components (e.g. MGDG vs. DGDG). Overall the changes in composition indicate an enhancement of the eukaryotic galactolipid biosynthesis pathway and a decrease in the prokaryotic pathway variant. DHAP and MG accumulation in the mutant may be responsible for many of the aberrant phenotypes.\t20097871\n",
